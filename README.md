# Video-Analytics-and-Machine-Learning

## Introduction
These codes are final assignment of Level 3' cource Video Analytics and Machine Learning, this assignment built a face recognition pipeline with following techinologies:
+ Image pre-processing 
+ Dataset augmentation
+ Feature extraction
+ Dimension reduction
+ SVM
+ Sliding window
+ Non-maximum suppresion
+ Validation with cross validation and ROC curves

## Platform
MatLab

## Implementation details
Students are provided two folders of positive and negative images for training classifier, positive images are human faces, one image one face, negative images have no face or incomplete human face. Students are required to create a face recognition pipeline to identify human face in testing images.

## Result
With appropriate configuration, our classification model can achieve 80-90% average accuracy on testing set
